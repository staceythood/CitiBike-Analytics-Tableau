# CitiBike-NYC-Tableau-Visualizations


From the data, visualizations were developed for:
1. Top Start and End Stations by number of trips
2. Map of top Start and End stations
3. Graph of number of subscribers versus short term customers
4. Peak use times
5. Ridership by gender for the period March - September 2019
6. Average trip duration and distance by gender


## Phenomenons Identified

### First Phenomemon:
The top Start and End stations with the most trips for the period March 2019 through September 2019 are almost all the same.  Plotting the top stations on a map showed that the top stations are generally located near major transit hubs.  Looking at the make up of customers, the number of subscribers is much higher than the number of short term customers for the previous 7 months.  From the start time data, peak use times appear to be during evening (5 - 7 pm) and morning (8-9 am) rush hours. Based on these three data sets, it appears that many riders use the Citi bikes for daily commuting.

### Second Phenomenon:
Although female ridership has gone up somewhat in the last 7 months, male riders still make up a greater percentge of riders (72%) than females (28%) as of September 2019.  By contrast, it appears that female riders' average trip durations and distances are higher than males.  Further efforts to boost female ridership may lead to greater per trip revenue.
